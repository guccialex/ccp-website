# ccp-website
splitting the ccp game, the website and the websocket server



pull the ccp game

use that for the wasm_builder's dependancies

wasm_builder creates the wasm files and puts them in the chessscheckersgame folder's wasm files

then serve the files in the gamefinder_server and chesscheckersgame as static files
